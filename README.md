# Portfolio

Here is a place I will document my progression through Sparta Global and hopefully my past.


##First stage

My first upload to the repository is a representation of experience with HTML, CSS, SCSS and bootstrap.

To compile the SCSS into CSS:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-sass
$ cd CSS
$ node-sass main.scss>main.css
```

* Business and Self improvement
* Basic web development
* 4 Project mainly based around JS and its frameworks

Forming a website built around my CV and Projects is the first step to a healthy and presentable Portfolio. Through out the 12-14 weeks in Sparta Global this Portfolio will expand and become a strong foundation to which will be the building blocks to a viable candidate as a consultant.

#Coming soon...

JavaScript will be incorporated with in the repository by then end of the week.
