# Portfolio

Here is a place I will document my progression through Sparta Global and hopefully my past.


##First stage

My first upload to the repository is a representation of experience with HTML, CSS, SCSS and bootstrap.

To compile the SCSS into CSS:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-sass
$ cd CSS
$ node-sass main.scss>main.css
```

* Business and Self improvement
* Basic web development
* The unknown, a.k.a the future!
